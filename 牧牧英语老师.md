Hi 
I am looking for a long-term English tutor with  for my 4-year-old son, Lucas. Ideally, we would like the lessons to take place 4 times a week, with each session lasting 25 minutes. Since Lucas is currently attending school, our available time for lessons start at 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM (Shanghai Time Zone).

Here is a short introduction to Lucas:  
He understands some English and can say a few words and short sentences. Lucas knows the names of colors, shapes, the alphabet, seasons, weather, days of the week, numbers up to 20, fruits, and many types of vehicles. 

Please let me know if this schedule works for you and if you are interested in teaching Lucas.

Hi [Tutor's Name],

The trial lesson was fantastic! Lucas really enjoyed it, and I’m considering subscribing to your tutoring services for him. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.

We are looking for a long-term tutor for Lucas, with lessons scheduled 4 times a week (25 minutes each) at fixed times. Do you offer any discounts for long-term packages?

Since Lucas is currently attending school, our available time for lessons would be between 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM (Shanghai Time Zone). Could you let me know if you have availability during this time?

As this will be a long-term commitment, I’d also appreciate it if you could share more details about how your classes are structured and the topics you plan to cover to support Lucas’s learning.

Thank you so much for your time! I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,

Here’s a short introduction about my son, which might help for our trial lesson:

Lucas is a cheerful 4-year-old boy who has a big sweet tooth! He loves chocolate, ice cream, potato chips, and other treats. He also enjoys spaghetti with tomato sauce and steak.

To help him learn English, we let him watch cartoons, and his favorite show is _Steve and Maggie_. He finds Steve, the funny and silly man, hilarious, and he loves Maggie, the magical black bird who often plays tricks on Steve. Lucas especially enjoys saying “abracadabra!” and laughing along with the show.

He’s very curious about mysterious things, especially Halloween-related elements. I think he would love playing “trick or treat.” Lucas also enjoys playing with others and has a playful personality.

As a family, we often go camping in the park during spring, and we enjoy swimming together at the pool. Lucas loves going to the beach, where he has fun playing in the sand.

Feel free to reach out if you need more information about Lucas.
