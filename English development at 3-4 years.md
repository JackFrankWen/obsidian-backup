## Sentences and grammar in language development



## Conversations and language development

At this age, your child might **tell stories that follow a theme** and often have a beginning and end. But they might need a lot of prompting to keep the story moving. You might have to ask, ‘And then what happened?’

Your child might reason, predict things and start to express empathy. They’ll also use a lot of ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘where’, ‘who’ and ‘how’ questions to find out more about their world.

As your child gets closer to 4 years, they’ll start to tell you about what they’re thinking. They might start conversations using questions like ‘Guess what?’ They’ll talk about all sorts of different topics and their **questions might be more abstract and complex**. For example, ‘If it keeps raining, will we have to build a boat to get to Grandma’s?’

By age 4, **most adults will understand your child**, although your child might not pronounce some words the right way. They might still have trouble pronouncing words that include the sounds ‘l’, ‘th’ or ‘r’.


## Play, communication and language development

By now, your child will be able to do some simple negotiation with other children. For example, they’ll be able to talk about who can play with a toy first.

At around 4 years, your child might even be able to explain why they want an object from another child – for example, ‘Can I have the green pencil? I want to colour in the grass’.

And at this age, your child will begin to **use language in role play**. For example, they can pretend to be ‘mummy’ and copy their mother’s tone and words.
