## Vocabulary and language development in children at 3-4 years

Your child learns **a lot of new words** by listening to you and other people and guessing from context. They also learn from new experiences and from listening to stories read aloud. Your child still understands many more words than they can say.

Your child will learn and use:

- more connecting words like ‘because’, ‘and’ or ‘if’ #连接词 #todo 
- more numbers
- names for groups of things like ‘vegetables’ or ‘animals’
- family terms like ‘aunty’ or ‘brother’.

## Sentences and grammar in language development

Your child is learning more about how to put words together into sentences.

This means that your child might begin to **use more complex sentences** that include words like ‘because’, ‘so’, ‘if’ and ‘when’ – for example, ‘I don’t like that because it’s yucky’.[[并列句]][[复杂句]] #todo

Also, your child will show that they **understand the basic rules** of language. For example, your child will start using possessives like ‘Daddy’s hat’. You’ll hear past and present tense too, like ‘talked’ and ‘talk’. #todo 

And your child will often apply these rules strictly across all examples, not realising that sometimes English breaks its own rules. For example, ‘He runned away’ instead of ‘He ran away’.

By this age, your child might be using ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’ correctly. But they might confuse the use of negatives. For example, if you say, ‘Don’t you want to go to the park?’, your child might reply, ‘I don’t not want to go’.

## Conversations and language development

At this age, your child might **tell stories that follow a theme** and often have a beginning and end. But they might need a lot of prompting to keep the story moving. You might have to ask, ‘And then what happened?’

Your child might reason, predict things and start to express empathy. They’ll also use a lot of ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘where’, ‘who’ and ‘how’ questions to find out more about their world. #todo

As your child gets closer to 4 years, they’ll start to tell you about what they’re thinking. They might start conversations using questions like ‘Guess what?’ They’ll talk about all sorts of different topics and their **questions might be more abstract and complex**. For example, ‘If it keeps raining, will we have to build a boat to get to Grandma’s?’

By age 4, **most adults will understand your child**, although your child might not pronounce some words the right way. They might still have trouble pronouncing words that include the sounds ‘l’, ‘th’ or ‘r’.

## Understanding and language development

When your child doesn’t understand what you say, they might ask you to explain or ask you what specific words mean.

Your child will **understand instructions that have more than 2 steps**, as long as they’re about familiar things – for example, ‘When I open the gate, take my hand, and then we’ll walk to the corner’.

Also, your child will understand questions most of the time, especially if they’re about something that’s happening right now or something they can see. And they’ll **understand slightly complicated explanations**, as long as they can see the results themselves. For example, they’ll understand an explanation like, ‘When the sun shines on things, it makes them hot. The water in the dog’s bowl has been in the sun. Feel how warm it is’. #todo 

By 4 years, your child might be able to understand and use words to express basic emotions like ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘angry’ or ‘surprised’. [[形容词]]

And your child might also know one or more colours and can compare things – for example, ‘This carrot is longer than that one’.[[形容词和副词比较级]]】 #todo

## Play, communication and language development

By now, your child will be able to do some simple negotiation with other children. For example, they’ll be able to talk about who can play with a toy first.

At around 4 years, your child might even be able to explain why they want an object from another child – for example, ‘Can I have the green pencil? I want to colour in the grass’.

And at this age, your child will begin to **use language in role play**. For example, they can pretend to be ‘mummy’ and copy their mother’s tone and words.
