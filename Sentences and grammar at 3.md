Your child is learning more about how to put words together into sentences.

This means that your child might begin to **use more complex sentences** that include words like ‘because’, ‘so’, ‘if’ and ‘when’ – for example, ‘I don’t like that because it’s yucky’.

Also, your child will show that they **understand the basic rules** of language. For example, your child will start using possessives like ‘Daddy’s hat’. You’ll hear past and present tense too, like ‘talked’ and ‘talk’.

And your child will often apply these rules strictly across all examples, not realising that sometimes English breaks its own rules. For example, ‘He runned away’ instead of ‘He ran away’.

By this age, your child might be using ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’ correctly. But they might confuse the use of negatives. For example, if you say, ‘Don’t you want to go to the park?’, your child might reply, ‘I don’t not want to go’.
