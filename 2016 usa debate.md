good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead New York I'm Lester Holt anchor of NBC Nightly News I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate the participants tonight are
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates a nonpartisan non-profit organization the commission drafted tonight's format and
the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns the 90-minute debate is divided into six
segments each 50 minutes long we'll explore three topic areas tonight achieving Prosperity America's Direction and securing America at the start of each segment I will ask the same lead
off question to both candidates and they will each have up to two minutes to respond from that point until the end of the segment we'll have an open discussion the questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns the audience here in the room
has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying I will invite you to applaud however at this moment as we welcome the candidates Democratic nominee for
president of the United States Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee for

president of the United States

foreign

well I don't expect us to cover all the

issues of this campaign tonight but I

remind everyone there are two more

presidential debates scheduled we are

going to focus on many of the issues

that voters tell us are most important

and we're going to press for specifics I

am honored to have this role but this

evening belongs to the candidates and

just as important to the American people

candidates we look forward to hearing

you articulate your policies and your

positions as well as your visions and

your values so let's begin we're calling this opening segment

achieving prosperity and Central to that is jobs there are two economic realities

in America today there's been a record

six straight years of job growth and new

census numbers show incomes have

increased at a record rate after years

of stagnation however income inequality

remains significant and nearly half of

Americans are living paycheck to

paycheck beginning with youth secretary

Clinton why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers
