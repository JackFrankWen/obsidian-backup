Hi Jasmine,

Here’s a short introduction about my son and may a little help for your a trial lessoion :

Lucas is a 4-year-old boy who loves chocolate, ice cream, potato chips, and other sweet treats. 
He likes spaghti with tomato saucer
We let him watch cartoons to learn English, and his favorite is _Steve and Maggie_. Steve is a funny, silly man, and Maggie is a magical black bird who often plays tricks on Steve. These tricks always make Lucas laugh, and he loves saying “abracadabra!”.

He’s also very interested in mysterious things, like Halloween elements. I think he would really enjoy playing “trick or treat.”
