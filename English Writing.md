Introduction to Lucas

Lucas is a 4-year-old boy. He understands some English and can say a few words and short sentences, though not very many. We started teaching him English when he was 1 year old.

Since last October, he has been attending an English class after school. He knows the names of colors, shapes, the alphabet, seasons, weather, days of the week, numbers up to 20, fruits, and many types of vehicles. He’s also learned about Halloween-related things, like pumpkins. His vocabulary is between 100 and 300 words, and he can sing some nursery songs, such as  "Johnny Johnny, Yes Papa."

He enjoys watching cartoons like Carl's Car Wash, Tobee and Kitty from the Super Simple Songs series, and his favorite, Steve and Maggie.

Lucas is fascinated by mysterious and magical themes, such as witches, vampires, flying brooms, and magical adventures.

My available  time is from 7:00 to 8:30 every day from Monday to Sunday, except Thursday In Shanghai Timezone.I am sure  the time we can match

帮我用英语写一个邮件的给我的英语老师Gail，邮件的内容是关于更改上英语课的方式,Lucas 在上课的时候走神,一边上课一边玩抽屉里的剪刀，原因是上课的课内容比较无聊，教他in ,between,under,这些词汇，我认为，牧牧才四岁，学习英语需要通过感兴趣的方式学习，可以通看动画片,，然后看的过程中，然后停下去问他这些方位词‘between,under,on,in’，
Hello Gail.Hope you well.
I have some suggestion about English Class:

Dear Gail,

I hope you well.

I wanted to share some thoughts about Lucas’s recent English lessons and see if we can make some adjustments. During class, I’ve noticed that Lucas  gets distracted , he was playing with scissors in the drawer during the last session. I think this might be because the lesson content feels a bit uninteresting to him. Teaching words like in, between, under, and on is, of course, important, but perhaps we could explore a more engaging approach.

Since Lucas is only four years old, I believe he learns best through activities that capture his interest. For instance, we could use animated cartoons with engaging stories as a learning tool. While watching, we can pause at certain moments and ask him about these positional words based on what’s happening in the story. This method would allow him to learn while staying involved and entertained. After a few lessons, we could then use the same video from the day before as a test to check his understanding of the positional words.

Please let me know your thoughts on this idea, or if you have other suggestions for making the lessons more engaging for him. I really appreciate all the effort you’ve put into teaching Lucas and want to ensure that he enjoys the learning process as much as possible.

Thank you so much for your understanding and support!

Best regards,

Hi Gail,

Thanks for you rely.



Dear Gail,

Thank you so much for your response. I now understand that during Lucas's English class last night, you were using a video without sound to test his English level. I had mistakenly thought you were using the video to teach him prepositions. I appreciate the clarification, and we will make sure to help if Lucas gets distracted or loses focus during the class.

I’d also like to share some thoughts about Lucas’s English learning path:

1. Long-term learning plan
    I believe you are very professional in teaching, and Lucas really enjoys learning with you. For his English studies, we are planning to have 4 to 5 lessons per week under your guidance in the long term. We hope that after the initial English level test, we can formally start his lessons. It would be ideal to have monthly test to track his progress. If there are areas where Lucas needs improvement, we as parents will actively help him review and reinforce those topics.
    
2. Clarifying concepts during test
    In one of the test, Lucas struggled to distinguish between a tiger, a lion, and a cheetah. It would be great if you could provide images and some detailed explanations to help him better differentiate them.
    

Once again, thank you for your dedication to Lucas’s learning journey. We are very grateful for your hard work and look forward to seeing Lucas grow in his English skills under your teaching.

Best regards,
Jack
