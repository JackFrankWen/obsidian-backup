  
## USE
  



### We use the past progressive to say that something was in progress (going on) around a particular past time.Â 
'What were you doing at eight o'clock yesterday evening? I was watching TV 

When I got up this morning the sun was shining the birds were singing,...

### 3  We often use the past progressive together with a simple past tense. The past progressive refers to a longer 'background' action or situation; the simple past refers to a shorter action or
As I was walking down the road, I saw James.

The phone rang while I was having dinner

Mozart died while he was composing the Requiem

###   not used for repeated actions
  

The past progressive is not the normal tense for talking about repeated or habitual past actions. The simple past is usually used with this meaning.


I rang the bell six times (Not i was ring the bell six times)
When i was child, I went to school
###   used for shorter, temporary actions and situations
The past progressive, like other progressive forms , is used for temporary actions and situations. When we talk about longer, more permanent situations we use the simple past. Compare:
It happened while I was living in Eastbourne last year._
I lived in London for ten years while I was a child._
 When I got home, water was running down the kitchen walls._
When they first discovered the river, they thought it ran into the Atlantic._
###    special uses

Because we often use the past progressive to talk about something that is a 'background', not the main 'news', we can make something seem less important by using this tense. Compare:
  

_I had lunch with the President yesterday,_ (important piece of news)

_I was having lunch with the President yesterday, and she said.._. (as if there was nothing special for the speaker about lunching with the President)
