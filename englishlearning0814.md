## writing

Today I read a book called is intimate relationship.The whole book is written by Rowland Miller who is psycholeege and helped many family who is trouble.

I woke up at 8 o'clock yesterday and made a potato cake for breakfast. Then I noticed that Lucas's mom was still sleeping, which meant no one could help Lucas brush his teeth, so I helped him with that. Afterward, I went to work.

At the office, I read a book about relationships between lovers and practiced my English listening skills by listening to the 2016 U.S. presidential debate.

I m going to prepare lunch.What do you want to eat for lunch?
